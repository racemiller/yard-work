# Yard Projects

</header>

This is a work in progress. My goal for this repo is to keep track of useful information regarding yard care.

This will eventually contain things like:

- Sprinkler timing & configuration
- Info regarding herbicides, insecticides, and fertilizer; including chemical/brand names, concentration amounts, and application frequency.
- Any changes I make to irrigation and why, so I don't question myself next season.
- Tips and ideas on how to take care of my yard.
