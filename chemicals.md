# Chemicals

## Pesticides

I stopped using pest control services early summer 2025. I haven't had to deal with any pests, although I still have either a mouse or bat problem in the backyard. Almost every day there is a decent amount of poop on the concrete patio. Still need to look into that.

## Insecticides

I stopped using Aptive early summer 2025. Luckily so far I haven't had any out of control insect problems. I bought some straight [Bifen I/T](https://diypestcontrol.com/bifen-it) and sprayed the perimeter of the house, the garden beds, and all around the shed. Since then I've only had to deal with one wasp's nest (which was way up in the eve of the roof). I believe this should be applied at least quarterly, but I think once in spring and once in early fall should be fine.

Since this is my first year without Aptive, I don't know what the fall/winter insect situation is going to look like.

I pay Mosquito Hero to spray our grass and trees for mosquitos, and they say their stuff works well on box elder bugs as well as anything with an exoskeleton. So far so good.

## Herbicides

Still paing WeedMan to take care of this for me. They do a good job. It looks like they use [Sublime](https://diypestcontrol.com/sublime-herbicide) for general weed control. I need to look through past invoices to see what else they're using on my yard so I can potentially duplicate their process for cheaper.

## Fertilizers

Still using WeedMan, and this is the least researched part of my lawn care routine. Right now I believe they do fertilizer twice a year, plus pre-emergent in early spring. They also do a double-pass aeration and overseeding in the fall which seems to be helping.
