# Lawn

## General Info

- You have clay soil. It retains a lot of moisture but if the ground is too dry or too compacted it will not absorb water very quickly.
    - Even under good circumstances, I don't think it will be able to absorb more than 60 minutes of watering at a time. May even be less.
